# rock-paper-scissors

A simple rock paper scissors game with a very minimalist GUI.

## What I learned

* Create arrays
* Generate random strings/numbers
* Write clean(er) code than before
* Use Git branches
* Create a GUI
* Scope
* Use CLI
* Use VS Code

## Challenges

Understanding scope was the most challenging part of this project. Ultimately, it 
helped me wrap my head around the concept of global scope in the JavaScript environment.

Other challenges were posed by the hiatus I took. I had to refresh on a lot of concepts
in order to complete the project, but reviewing helped me catch mistakes I hadn't 
previously noticed. 

## Moving forward

* Review CSS exercises
* Review JS exercises
* Practice writing clean and readable code
* Write more efficiently; do more with less
* Pseudocode more, plan more
* Practice every day
